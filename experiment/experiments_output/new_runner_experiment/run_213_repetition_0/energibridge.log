It was founded around 495 AD by Persian Emperor Khosrow Khan and its name translates to \"The Place of Khosrow\". It was initially called \"Khosroya\" but later changed to Bakhsh after the death of his son, Sultan Shah.\n\nBakhsh is renowned for being one of Iran's oldest inhabited villages. The village has a rich history that dates back several thousand years and it features many unique traditions and customs. One such tradition is traditional Persian dress which is known as \"khaftani\" or \"Khalaf\". This dress allows people to cover their head with a scarf or burqa, which makes them look like men.\n\nBakhsh is also famous for its traditional music and dance, particularly the bandar. The bandar is a type of tabla that originated in Bakhsh. It consists of four or five players playing different instruments such as tabla, guitar, flute and bass.\n\nIn addition to these traditions, Bakhsh has also been known for its cuisine, which consists mainly of meat dishes and vegetables, including saurkabi, a type of lamb dish. The people in Bakhsh are very friendly and hospitable, making them one of the most welcoming communities in Iran.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[151644,872,198,641,220,16,15,15,4244,11,4486,2968,752,1995,911,425,21758,927,151645,198,151644,77091,198,33,21758,927,374,264,14126,7407,304,279,434,1561,37794,315,10259,13,1084,572,18047,2163,220,19,24,20,9630,553,49861,34314,20165,436,651,24287,323,1181,829,46918,311,330,785,10771,315,20165,436,651,3263,1084,572,15102,2598,330,42,41835,3352,64,1,714,2937,5497,311,425,21758,927,1283,279,4545,315,806,4438,11,74986,36517,382,33,21758,927,374,35948,369,1660,825,315,10259,594,23513,69498,32789,13,576,14126,702,264,9080,3840,429,12713,1182,3807,16183,1635,323,432,4419,1657,4911,30906,323,34769,13,3776,1741,13815,374,8606,49861,8511,892,374,3881,438,330,74,81760,5559,1,476,330,42,11866,2577,3263,1096,8511,6147,1251,311,3421,862,1968,448,264,67271,476,7795,15445,11,892,3643,1105,1401,1075,2953,382,33,21758,927,374,1083,11245,369,1181,8606,4627,323,15254,11,7945,279,7055,277,13,576,7055,277,374,264,943,315,40546,429,43753,304,425,21758,927,13,1084,17167,315,3040,476,4236,4217,5619,2155,23316,1741,438,40546,11,16986,11,95712,323,21529,382,641,5256,311,1493,30906,11,425,21758,927,702,1083,1012,3881,369,1181,35005,11,892,17167,14576,315,13041,25779,323,23880,11,2670,822,324,74,25084,11,264,943,315,38306,12000,13,576,1251,304,425,21758,927,525,1602,11657,323,20407,15368,11,3259,1105,825,315,279,1429,35287,10744,304,10259,13],"total_duration":1505371832,"load_duration":640441306,"prompt_eval_count":23,"prompt_eval_duration":27967000,"eval_count":268,"eval_duration":794926000}Energy consumption in joules: 96.38284393310546 for 3.0277314 sec of execution.
